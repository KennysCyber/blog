            <img src="/assets/images/Code/windowsf/windowsf.png" alt="windowsf cover">
            <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
            <strong>~This idea came from an incident I handled where a suspicious USB was found plugged into an endpoint we had physical access to. Forensics’ first move was to capture memory and disk images, but that takes time, and we needed to correlate what was happening now with our logs. To bypass LAPS and get actionable info fast, I researched what data would be useful to grab and which directories are accessible by default to non-privileged accounts. And so, this approach was born! Feel free to tweak it for your environment—it’ll need some tuning to fit your setup.~
            </p>
            </strong>
                This project involves creating a PowerShell script designed for digital forensics, capable of capturing critical system information without requiring administrative privileges. The script collects data such as command history, scheduled tasks, startup items, running processes, network connections, DNS queries, and recently modified files, saving them to a timestamped folder on the user's desktop for analysis by a Security Operations Center (SOC) team.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a lightweight forensics tool for evidence collection in environments with restricted permissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Windows workstation, PowerShell enabled for standard user. (THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE'S ENVIRONMENT; IT IS MEANT AS A TEMPLATE FOR YOU TO WORK FROM)!!!!</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware Used:</strong> Windows-based system (tested on Windows 10/11).</li>
                <li><strong>Software Used:</strong> PowerShell 5.1 or later, Windows Command Prompt.</li>
                <li><strong>Skills Learned:</strong> PowerShell scripting, forensic data collection, error handling, log generation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Script Breakdown and Forensic Relevance</h2>

    ipconfig /displaydns | Out-File "$desktopPath\DNS_Queries.txt"
    Write-Log "Captured DNS queries"
}
catch {
    Write-Log "Error capturing DNS queries: $_"
}</code></pre>

            <h3>2.8 Recently Modified Files</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Relevance:</strong> Recently modified files in key directories like Temp and AppData can indicate malicious activity, such as temporary files created by malware or attacker scripts. Sorting by modification time helps prioritize files for further investigation.
            </p>
            <pre><code id="code8"># Capture Recently Modified Files in Key Directories
try {
    $dirsToCheck = @(
        "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Temp",
        "$env:APPDATA"
    )

    foreach ($dir in $dirsToCheck) {
        if (Test-Path $dir) {
            $dirName = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($dir)
            dir $dir -Recurse | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 50 | Out-File "$desktopPath\RecentFiles_$dirName.txt"
        }

            <h2>3. Tips and Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>Practical advice and insights gained from developing the script:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Run the script in at user level by copy and pasting into shell not running as a .PS1 to avoid permission issues and execution policy, as it is designed for "non-privileged environments".</li>
                <li><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Review the log file (<code>CaptureLog.txt</code>) to identify any errors during execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Zip the output folder before sending to the SOC team to preserve file integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Error handling is critical to ensure the script continues running even if certain data cannot be captured.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Add support for capturing browser history or clipboard contents to enhance evidence collection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The PowerShell forensics script successfully captures critical system information without requiring administrative privileges, making it suitable for rapid evidence collection in restricted environments. The script enhances forensic investigations by providing structured, timestamped data for SOC analysis. Future enhancements may include additional data sources and automated analysis features.
