        <p class="about">
            Hey! Welcome to my corner of the cyber world. This blog is my personal space to learn, teach,
            experiment, and document everything I pick up along the way. I learn best by writing things down,
            so think of this place as a blend between a public notebook, a knowledge vault, and a playground
            for whatever cyber rabbit hole I fall into next.
        </p>

        <p class="about">
            I’ve always gravitated toward being a <strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong> in cybersecurity — red team,
            blue team, DFIR, cloud, threat intel, hardware tinkering — if it sparks curiosity, I’m diving in.
            (Well… everything except GRC.)
        </p>

        <p class="about">
            I started this blog not only to reinforce my own learning, but also to share projects, write-ups,
            home lab builds, weird ideas, and cyber experiments with anyone who finds them interesting. If you
            spot anything wrong, outdated, or cursed — call me out. I’m here to learn and improve, just like
            everyone else trying to level up in this massive ocean of professionals.
        </p>

        <p class="about">
            Outside of work, me and some buddies love running weekend CTF sessions. If you’re into rooting boxes,
            breaking stuff, and learning as a team, hit me up. Otherwise, I’ll see you in cyberspace or at DEFCON.
        </p>
