            Hey what up guys, please feel free to explore my blog and hopefully something cool catches your eye. I tried not to make my write-ups too long, as we all know what it's like reading a white-paper-sized article... not fun. Little bit about me — I'm a passionate cybersecurity nerd. I've dabbled in most fields and love the idea of being the jack of all trades when it comes to cyber. Decided to start this blog as a way to reinforce my learning and projects by making myself manifest them in a visual and written form. Also, I'm always telling friends and coworkers about my hardware projects, so I thought, what the heck, might as well add those as well. Feel free to explore and if you see anything off, call me out!! I encourage criticism and want to refine my craft, for I am not perfect and just another skid in a sea full of professionals.
        </p>

            Beyond my professional work, me and some buddies love a good weekend group CTF session. If this is something that interests you, lmk and let's root a box. Otherwise, I'll see you guys in Cyber Space or at DEFCON *!!
